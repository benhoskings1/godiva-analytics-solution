Over the last three years studying at the University of Warwick, I have developed a keen interest in software engineering, and more recently this has been focused on computer vision, data science and the applications of computational intelligence in healthcare. The completion of my dissertation project titled “Emotion Recognition from a Sequence of 3D Facial Point Clouds” has highlighted my interests in affective computing and computer vision, as well as the application machine leaning technologies to enhance multiple aspects of people’s lives.

From competing at an international level in Alpine Skiing whilst in school, to completing the London Marathon and two 70.3 Ironmans  by 21, sport has always been a major part of my life. I love to push myself by undertaking major sporting events and look forward to applying this dedication to the early stage of my career.
